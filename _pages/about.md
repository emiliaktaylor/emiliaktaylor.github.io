I am a second-year DPhil student in the Department of Statistics (StatML CDT) at the University of Oxford, supervised by Rob Cornish, Saifuddin Syed and Yee Whye Teh.

My research interests currently revolve around the mathematical understanding of deep generative models, and their application to scientific problems, using tools from geometry and category theory. In particular, I am interested in de novo molecular generation and related biochemical problems. 

#Further, I am also interested in the intersection of cognitive science and neuroscience with machine learning, for inspiring more effective and efficient reasoning and learning algorithms (beyond Transformers).

Previously, I obtained my BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and my MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford, where my master's thesis: "Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Manifold Learning" was supervised by Paul Rosa and Judith Rousseau. You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/leo_zhang_cv.pdf).
