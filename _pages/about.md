I am a first-year DPhil student in the Department of Statistics (StatMl CDT) at the University of Oxford. My current research interests include developing new methods for efficently adapting LLMs and applications of geometry within machine learning (e.g. deep generative models for manifold-valued data and geometric deep learning). I am supervised by Yee Whye Teh.

Previously, I obtained my BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and my MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford, where my master's thesis: "Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Manifold Learning" was supervised by Judith Rousseau and Paul Rosa.

If you have any questions or wish to discuss research, feel free to send me an email!
